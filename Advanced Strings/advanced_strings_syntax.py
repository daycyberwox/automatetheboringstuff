# Advanced String Syntax


# Escaping a single quote
print('That is Alice\'s cat.')

# Multiple lines
print("Hello there!\nHow are you\nI'm Fine.")


# Raw strings (Doesn't escape) - Prefix with a "r"
print(r'That is Carol\'s cat.')


# Multiline Strings - using triple quotes
print("""This is a cat napping scenario my dude!
    You get me?""")


# Manipulating Strings
spam = "Hello There!"
print(spam[0])   # grabs the 0th character in the string
